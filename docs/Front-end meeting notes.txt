We will create a search page where a user can enter a Twitter user's username. When the user hits search, it will return that the specified Twitter user's timeline, if it is public. 

This API endpoint retrieves a specified user's timeline:

Not related to Saturday (3/24) front-end meeting but we also designed a login page and a register page (probably will be a Typeform). Pics enclosed. 


What we need from backend team:
- what api routes should we send the data to?
- we have a pretty good understanding of how we should move data between apis, so let us know if you need clarification.
