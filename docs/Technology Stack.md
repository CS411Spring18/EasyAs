# Technology Stack

* Backend: We choose to use Node.js with Express for the server side architecture because we think Node is one of the most popular platform for web development. It would be nice to learn more about it.
* Frontend: We choose to use React.js with JSX for the client side because it is a trending framework in the industry. We have also considered use simple AJAX with jquery, but we want to try something that none of us has used before. Although we know it might be a huge challenge, we are still confident that we can pull it off.
* Database: We choose to use MongoDB as our database because the data we stored can easily be put in one object, so there is no need to use the relational constraints provided by the relational database like MySQL.
